	<h3>
		About
	</h3>
	<p>
		GeanyGDB is a plugin for Geany which provides integrated debugging support within Geany via the
		GNU Debugger (GDB).
	</p>
	<p>
		Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment using the GTK2 toolkit.
	</p>
	<p>
		The GNU Debugger is a source-level debugger for C, C++, Fortran, Modula 2 and Java programs.
	</p>
	<p>
		It was developed and tested on openSUSE-10.3 with GDB-6.7.50. Other recent versions of GDB will
		probably work, but operating systems other than Linux-PC will not work, at least not without
		some considerable hacking.
	</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="current-version">
	<h3>
		Current Version
	</h3>
	<p>
		GeanyGDB now is part of the Geany-Plugins project. The current version of Geany-Plugins is
		0.18. The last stable release of GeanyGDB is 0.0.2. You are recommended to use the more current
		versions of GeanyGDB shipped with Geany-Plugins.
	</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="requirements">
	<h3>
		Requirements
	</h3>
	<p>
		If you like to compile Geany-Plugins yourself, you will need the GTK (&gt;= 2.8.0) libraries
		and header files. You will also need its dependency libraries and header files, such as Pango,
		Glib and ATK. All these files are available at <a class="reference external" href=
		"http://www.gtk.org">http://www.gtk.org</a> or as package via your distributor.
	</p>
	<p>
		And obviously, you will need have Geany installed. If you have Geany installed from the
		sources, you should be ready to go. If you are using a prepared package e.g. from your
		distribution you probably need to install an additional package, which might be called
		geany-dev or geany-devel. Please note that in order to compile and use GeanyGDB, you will need
		Geany 0.16 or later.
	</p>
	<p>
		Furthermore you need, of course, a C compiler and the Make tool. The GNU versions of these
		tools are recommended.
	</p>
	<p>
		And last but not least: GDB.
	</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="installation">
	<h3>
		Installation
	</h3>
	<p>
		Please consider to compile and/or install the Geany-Plugins project, as GeanyGDB now is part of
		Geany-Plugins.
	</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="documentation">
	<h3>
		Documentation
	</h3>
	<p>
		There is no real documentation, but if you hover your mouse over the buttons in the GeanyGDBs
		sidebar panel in Geany the tooltips should give you some idea of what to do next. There are
		also a few &quot;rough draft&quot; notes below:
	</p>
	<p>
		Most of the console output from GDB is sent to the &quot;Compiler&quot; message window in
		Geany, and you can send standard commands to GDB using the &quot;Console&quot; entry on the
		debug sidebar. This should be used with caution, since GDB's machine interface and console
		interface don't always play well together.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also note that the plugin sets its own internal breakpoint #1 to grab the program's PID on
		startup, so any user-specified breakpoint numbers begin at #2, and if you manually delete the
		#1 breakpoint it will likely cause you some problems.
	</p>
	<p>
		Whenever the target program hits a breakpoint or encounters a segfault etc. it will try to open
		the appropriate source file and jump to the correct line.
	</p>
	<p>
		To examine the state of the program's variables, you can click on the &quot;Stack&quot; button
		in the debug sidebar. Note that the interaction between the plugin and GDB can sometimes be
		quite slow, so please be patient when waiting for the dialogs to open.
	</p>
	<p>
		The &quot;Add breakpoint&quot;, &quot;Add watchpoint&quot;, and &quot;Run to&quot; dialogs will
		try to suggest some values based on your current position in whatever file you have open in
		Geany, but if you don't like the choice, just click the &quot;Clear&quot; button and type in
		whatever you please.
	</p>
	<p>
		GeanyGDB tries to enable only the buttons that are relevant to the current state, but
		ocassionally it might end up getting things wrong. If this happens, you should be able to click
		the &quot;Unload&quot; button and everything will be reset.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you try to unload the plugin using the plugin manager while it has a program loaded, the
		plugin manager might appear to hang for a few seconds, while GDB tries to shut down. Again,
		just be patient, but note that it is much better use the &quot;Unload&quot; button in the debug
		sidebar before trying to disable the plugin.
