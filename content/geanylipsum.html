	<h3>
		About
	</h3>
	<p>
		GeanyLipsum is a plugin for Geany that implements a Lorem Ipsum generator to insert placeholder
		text into your document.
	</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="installation">
	<h3>
		Installation
	</h3>
	<p>
		This version of the plugin is installed with the combined geany-plugins release. Please check
		README of this package
	</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="usage">
	<h3>
		Usage
	</h3>
	<p>
		After installed successfully, load the plugin in Geany's plugin manager and a new menu item in
		the Tools menu will appear.
	</p>
	<p>
		To insert Lorem Ipsum to your document, either use the appearing menu item or use the keystroke
		which you can configure inside Geany's preferences dialog. Inside the dialog you can set up a
		length of the text. Values between 1 and 5000 chars are available here. If you choose a length
		that is not fitting with the length of the Lipsum snippet shipped with this plugin it will be
		repeated and cut so you will always get the wished number of chars inserted.
	</p>
