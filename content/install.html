<h2>Install Geany-Plugins</h2>
<p>There are different ways to get the Geany-Plugins project onto your system.
The easiest is, to ask the package manager software of the distribution
you are using.</p>

<h3>Packages</h3>
<h4>Fedora (yum)</h4>
<code>yum install geany-plugins</code>
<p>or do a</p>

<code>yum search geany-plugins</code>
<p>to get the available plugins listed and
install the plugin you like to use via</p>
<code>yum install geany-plugins-{pluginname}</code>

<h4>Debian</h4>
<p>Install via</p>
<code>apt-get install geany-plugins</code>

<h4>Ubuntu</h4>
<p>Install via:</p>
<code>sudo apt-get install geany-plugins</code>
<p>or</p>
<code>sudo apt-get install geany-plugin-{pluginname}</code>
<p>To see the list of plugins available in the repositories, use:</p>
<code>sudo apt-cache seach geany</code>
<p>Alternatively (GUI method), use Synaptic (System -> Administration ->
Synaptic Package Manager) and search for "geany".

Note: you must have the "Universe" repository enabled.
</p>

<h4>Other distributions</h4>
<p>Please feel free to let us know of any other install command for the
distribution or rather package manager you are using.</p>

<h3>Compile yourself</h3>
<p>See the downloads page to get a tarball of Geany-Plugins and unpack it.
(tar xzf tarball.tar.gz or tar xjf tarball.tar.bz2). Then use either waf or
autotools, to compile and install it. Note you will need to have different
compile tools (such as gcc) and libraries (e.g. CTPL for GeanyGenDoc)
installed.</p>

<h4>waf</h4>
<p>Note that waf needs python to be installed, which is the case on most modern
Linux distributions. In case you do not have python installed, you may want
to read further with the autotools way below.<br />
To use waf </p>
<code>./waf configure<br />./waf build -p<br />./waf install</code>
<p>You can get more detailed information about the possibilities with waf via</p>
<code>./waf --help</code>

<h4>autotools</h4>
<p>This is the way to build Geany-Plugins which you may know better, because
it's more widely used. The possibility to use autotools to compile and install
Geany-Plugins is provided for compatibility reasons, if you do not have
installed python or there is any other reason which prevents you from using waf
<br />
For compiling Geany-Plugins with autotools, do the following:
</p>
<code>./configure<br />make<br />make install</code>
<p>You can get more detailed information about possibilities by running</p>
<code>./configure --help</code>
