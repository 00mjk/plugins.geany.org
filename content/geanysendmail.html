	<h3>
		About
	</h3>
	<p>
		GeanySendMail is a little plugin to send a document as attachment using the preferred mail
		client from inside Geany. It is similar to the envelope symbol of most office tools and
		requires a mail client that is supporting remote calls.
	</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="requirements">
	<h3>
		Requirements
	</h3>
	<p>
		For compiling the plugin yourself, you will need the GTK (&gt;= 2.8.0) libraries and header
		files. You will also need its dependency libraries and header files, such as Pango, Glib and
		ATK. All these files are available at <a class="reference external" href=
		"http://www.gtk.org">http://www.gtk.org</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		And obviously, you will need to have Geany installed. If you have Geany installed from the
		sources, you should be ready to go. If you used a prepared package e.g. from your distribution
		you probably need to install an additional package, this might be called geany-dev or
		geany-devel. Please note that in order to compile and use this plugin, you need Geany 0.16 or
		later (Geany Plugin API v116 or higher).
	</p>
	<p>
		Furthermore you need, of course, a C compiler and the Make tool. The GNU versions of these
		tools are recommended.
	</p>

	<h3>
		Installation
	</h3>
	<p>
		This version of the plugin is installed with the combined geany-plugins release. Please check
		README of this package or download stand alone version of plugin from <a class=
		"reference external" href=
		"http://frank.uvena.de/en/Geany/geanysendmail/">http://frank.uvena.de/en/Geany/geanysendmail/</a>

<div class="section" id="usage">
	<h3>
		Usage
	</h3>
	<p>
		After installed successfully, load the plugin in Geany's plugin manager and a new menu item in
		the Tools menu will appear. Before you can start you need to configure your mail client. This
		can be done in the configuration dialog (details on it later). You can also assign a keyboard
		shortcut in Geany's preferences dialog to send your document.
	</p>

	<p><a href="#contents">back to top</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="configuration">
	<h3>
		Configuration
	</h3>
	<p>
		In the configuration dialog you can set up a command that is called by the plugin to
		communicate with your mail client. Depending on what's your favorite mailer, the command will
		differ. A number of placeholders are available for doing this:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			%s: Will be replaced by the complete path of the file that should be send.
		</li>
		<li>
			%r: Will be replaced by one or more recipient's email address that can be
				entered inside a separate dialog. (Please remember during input, what your mail client
				is expecting here)
		</li>
		<li>
			%b: Will be replace by the file name. For a file /tmp/foo.baa it will be
				replaced by foo.baa.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Depending on how you like to use, you can combine all of the placeholders to build up your
		command. It is possible to use one placeholder several times. When using keep care, as the
		placeholders are replace step by step, so a filename containing %b might have some funny
		outcome. However, examples could be:
	</p>
	<p>Sylpheed:</p>
	<code>sylpheed --attach &quot;%f&quot; --compose &quot;%r&quot;</code>

	<p>mutt:</p>
	<code>mutt -s &quot;Sending '%b'&quot; -a &quot;%f&quot; &quot;%r&quot;</code>

	<p>Mozilla Thunderbird at Windows:</p>
	<code>&quot;C:Program FilesMozilla Thunderbirdthunderbird.exe&quot;
			-compose to=&quot;%r&quot;,subject=&quot;%b&quot;,attachment=&quot;%f&quot;</code>

	<p>
		In theory it should also work together with tools like Microsoft Outlook - Unfortunately the
		author wasn't able to bring it up running. Input for the correct commandline is highly welcome.

		%b and %r will be replaced without any quotes.
