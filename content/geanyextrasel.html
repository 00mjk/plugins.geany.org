		Usage
	</h3>
	<p>
		Under Tools -&gt; Extra Selection, there are 3 new items: &quot;Column mode&quot;, &quot;Select
		to line&quot; and &quot;Select to matching brace&quot;. Normally these should be bound to keys,
		for example Alt-c, Alt-Shift-l and Control-Shift-b. Now:
	</p>
	<ol class="arabic">
		<li>
			<p class="first">
				Position the cursor on an opening brace and invoke &quot;Select to matching brace&quot;.
				The cursor will move to the closing brace, and the braced area will be selected.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p class="first">
				Position the cursor on line 10, invoke &quot;Select to line&quot; and enter 15. The cursor
				will move to line 15, and the area between the previous and the new current cursor position
				will be selected.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p class="first">
				Select a small rectangular area and press Control-Alt-Shift-Right. The cursor will move to
				the next word, extending the rectangurar selection. The complete new keys list is:
			</p>
			<p>
				Control-Alt-Shift Extends the selection to ----------------- ------------------------ Left
				Previous word Right Next word Up Previous paragraph Down Next paragraph Home Start of file
				End End of file
			</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Unfortunately, holding Alt for rectangular selection has some problems, which apply both to the
		standard Geany keys and these added by the plugin. Under Windows, Alt and the keypad keys
		generate unicodes, even if used with Shift or Control. With X11, some
		Alt-(Ctrl)-(Shift)-movement keys may be used by the window manager for switching to the
		previous/next desktop, moving windows etc. So then:
	</p>
	<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
		<li>Turn &quot;Column mode&quot; on. While active, the (Control)-Shift-movement keys will
		select a rectangle instead of stream without the need to hold Alt (in fact, the
		(Control)-Alt-Shift-movement keys will be temporarily blocked). This way, you will avoid the
		Alt key problems mentioned above, and it's move convinient to select while holding Shift only.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		The column mode is global, not per-document. However, (de)activating it will change the
		selection (if any) to stream/rectangle for the current document only.
	</p>
	<p>
		The column mode applies to the movement keys only - not to mouse selection, find functions etc.
